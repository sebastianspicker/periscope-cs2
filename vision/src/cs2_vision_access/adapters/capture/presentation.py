"""Fullscreen contour presenter for the second-device pipeline.

The primary vision topology is:

    gaming PC --HDMI--> splitter --> capture card --> device 2 (Windows)
                                                        |
                                              capture -> segment -> outline
                                                        |
                                              composite 1:1 over the frame
                                                        |
                                              fullscreen present

Device 2 opens a borderless, chrome-less, topmost, non-activating window sized
exactly to the monitor the player looks at, and blits the composited frame at
native resolution. Because the pixels shown are the pixels captured, alignment
is a solved problem: nothing is scaled, nothing is moved.

Only the composited output ever reaches this window, inference diagnostics,
pause badges and hotkey hints stay on the preview path. On Windows the window
can additionally exclude itself from screen capture (streamproof), so a
recording or stream of the gaming PC never shows the outline even when the
overlay runs on the same machine.

The pure geometry lives here so tests can drive it without a display; the
ctypes/Win32 specifics live in ``presenter.py``.
