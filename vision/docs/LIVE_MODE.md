# Live mode

Command: `cs2-vision live`.

Captures frames from screen, a capture device, or a file, runs a segmenter, and draws outlines. Optional transparent overlay (Win32 layered window on Windows, Cocoa when available on macOS, tkinter fallback).

Second-device composite (HDMI capture card on another machine, contours shown fullscreen): [CONTOUR_PIPELINE.md](CONTOUR_PIPELINE.md).

Desktop alternative: `cs2-vision gui` - same engine, tkinter dashboard. See [CLI.md](CLI.md).

## Prerequisites

- Installed package (`uv sync`)
- ONNX model + matching `.model.json` manifest (for backends that require one)
- Screen capture: OS permission (macOS Screen Recording)
- Overlay over CS2 on Windows: borderless windowed display mode

## Quick start

```bash
uv run cs2-vision download-model yolo26n-seg --output-dir artifacts

uv run cs2-vision live \
  --model artifacts/yolo26n-seg.onnx \
  --manifest artifacts/yolo26n-seg.model.json \
  --class-name person \
  --source-type screen \
  --output-mode alpha \
  --overlay
```

List capture devices:

```bash
uv run cs2-vision live --list-devices
```

## Config file

```bash
cp configs/cs2-vision-config.example.json cs2-vision-config.json
# edit model.path, model.manifest, input.source_type, display options
uv run cs2-vision live --config cs2-vision-config.json
```

`cs2-vision setup --auto` can scaffold a config and download a default model. Root `cs2-vision-config.json` is gitignored. CLI flags override config keys.

## Important flags

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--source-type` | `screen`, `capture-device`, or `file` |
| `--monitor` | 1-based monitor index for screen capture |
| `--input-device` | Device index, name substring, or file path |
| `--output-mode` | `overlay`, `alpha`, or `green` |
| `--output-stream` | Publish rendered frames to a shared-memory ring (`shm:<name>`) for a second process |
| `--max-capture-age-ms` | Drop capture frames older than this many ms of capture time (0 = off) |
| `--fourcc` | Capture codec hint (`MJPG`, `YUY2`) for capture cards |
| `--backend` | OpenCV capture backend hint (`auto`, `dshow`, `avfoundation`, `v4l2`, `msmf`) |
| `--overlay` | Transparent always-on-top overlay window |
| `--overlay-x` / `--overlay-y` | Overlay window top-left (pixels) |
| `--overlay-monitor` | Overlay monitor index (`0` = auto) |
| `--headless` | No preview window |
| `--segmenter-backend` | Backend name (default `ultralytics-onnx`) |
| `--class-name` | Class filter (e.g. `person` or `player`) |
| `--confidence` | Score threshold |
| `--device` | Inference device (`cpu`, `cuda:0`, …) |
| `--temporal-enabled` | Opt-in suppress-only stability filter |
| `--temporal-min-frames` | Consecutive matches required before draw (default 2 when enabled) |
| `--temporal-hold` | Optional hold-last-mask across short dropouts (off by default) |
| `--temporal-max-dropout` | Max hold frames when hold is on (`0` = no carry) |
| `--quality-gate` | Drop implausible detections before rendering: confidence floor, area bounds, finite geometry. Gated predictions are never drawn (`--quality-min-confidence`, `--quality-min-area-px` override the defaults) |
| `--smooth-tracks` | Persistent-track smoothing: exponential bbox smoothing (`1-exp(-k)` per update), fade-in on appear, bounded fade-out on vanish; geometry is always an affine transform of detector output, never invented |
| `--scene-reset` | Frame-difference scene-cut detection; a cut resets temporal and track association history so stale state never crosses a cut |

Full help: `uv run cs2-vision live --help`.

### Segmenter backends

Default is `ultralytics-onnx`. Other names accepted by `--segmenter-backend`:

| Backend | Role |
|---------|------|
| `ultralytics-onnx` | YOLO-seg ONNX (default) |
| `ultralytics-detect` | Box rectangles only |
| `rfdetr` | Optional RF-DETR (`[rfdetr]` extra) |
| `cs2-sam` | Vombit + EdgeSAM hybrid |
| `yolov10`, `nanodet` | Detect-only ORT backends |

Offline multi-backend timing: [BAKEOFF.md](BAKEOFF.md). Package map: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Temporal filter

Default is frame-sync only (policy off). With `--temporal-enabled`, unstable one-frame blips are suppressed until a detection matches for N consecutive frames. No track IDs. Hold-last-mask is a separate opt-in (`--temporal-hold`) and is not the default accessibility path - holding stale geometry risks outlining empty space or occluders. Outline CLI uses the same suppress-only idea under `--temporal-suppress` ([ACCESSIBILITY.md](ACCESSIBILITY.md)).

## Overlay positioning

The overlay can sit anywhere and auto-aligns to the captured region or selected monitor when placement flags are omitted. Persist placement under config keys `display.overlay_x`, `display.overlay_y`, and `display.overlay_monitor`.

## Hotkeys

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| 1 / 2 / 3 | Outline presets |
| + / = | Increase outline width |
| - | Decrease outline width |
| T | Toggle temporal filter |
| O | Cycle output mode |
| F | Toggle fill |
| Space | Pause |
| H | Diagnostics |
| Q / Escape | Quit |

Global hotkeys (`RegisterHotKey`) work in overlay mode on Windows even when the game has focus; there they are registered as **Ctrl+Alt+<key>** (for example Ctrl+Alt+Q to quit) so bare keys are not swallowed system-wide, and a warning is logged for any combination another application already owns. In the preview window the plain keys above apply. Other platforms are best-effort while the preview window has focus. The desktop GUI exposes the same actions as buttons.

## Off-screen edge cues

`--edge-cues` draws a clamped arrow at the frame edge for each tracked player
whose centre leaves the frame. Cues are keyed by the smoothed track, capped at
eight, and sorted by confidence. They are off by default because they add
clutter in busy scenes. The arrow points toward the player; it does not claim
that the player is visible, since a wall can still sit between you.

They work best with `--smooth-tracks`, where the track survives the frame
edge. Without smoothing, cues follow only the current detection and blink.

## Desktop GUI

```bash
uv run cs2-vision gui
```

Tkinter dashboard with Capture / Model / Style / Overlay-Output / Run tabs. Runs the same `run_live_pipeline` engine in a background thread; overlay window optional. Needs no extra install (tkinter is stdlib). Details: [CLI.md](CLI.md).

## Operation notes

- Frame skipping kicks in when inference is slower than capture so the UI stays interactive.
- Capture reads reconnect with bounded backoff (1 s, 2 s, 4 s) and drain buffered frames after a successful reconnect; a card pulled and replugged mid-session recovers without a restart.
- `--max-capture-age-ms` bounds latency by dropping frames that are already stale. Without it, a slow stage turns into an ever-growing queue.
- `--output-stream shm:<name>` replaces (not adds to) any file `--output-sink`; it publishes the rendered frame into a 48-byte-header RGBA ring with newest-wins drops and torn-read detection. Consumers use `read_shared_frame`.
- Alpha and green modes are for external compositors (e.g. OBS), not for writing into the game process.
- Second-device composite (capture card + fullscreen presenter on another Windows box): [CONTOUR_PIPELINE.md](CONTOUR_PIPELINE.md).
- Prefer a CS2-trained `player` model for product experiments; COCO `person` is a wiring check only.
