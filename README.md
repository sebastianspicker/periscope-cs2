# Periscope

Periscope contains two independently built and licensed CS2 research projects:
**Radar**, a simulation-first red/blue teaching lab, and **Vision**, a
pixel-only accessibility research package. They share a subject area but no
runtime code.

## Projects

| Path | Stack | License | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|---------|
| [`radar/`](radar/) | C++20, CMake | MIT | Educational red/blue lab: T0–T4 external radar scars and counters (sim + optional Windows real backends) |
| [`vision/`](vision/) | Python 3.11–3.13, `uv` | AGPL-3.0-only | Pre-alpha package `cs2-vision-access` (CLI `cs2-vision`): outline visible players from screen/video pixels only |

## Quick start

**Radar** — see [`radar/README.md`](radar/README.md). Build from `radar/`:

```bash
cmake -S radar -B radar/build/dev -DLR_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DLR_BUILD_STRATEGY_LAB=ON
cmake --build radar/build/dev -j
ctest --test-dir radar/build/dev --output-on-failure
```

**Vision** — see [`vision/README.md`](vision/README.md). From `vision/`:

```bash
cd vision
uv venv --python 3.12
uv sync --frozen --extra dev
uv run cs2-vision --help
```

```

Each subtree has its own `README`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `SECURITY`, and docs tree. Root files do not replace those.

The current dependency rules and placement guide are in
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). Run all portable repository
checks with:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify.py all
```

## Not a cheat product

Both tracks are research / teaching / accessibility scaffolding.

- **vision** never opens the game process, reads game memory, or injects input. Capture is external pixels (screen, capture device, or local video).
- **radar** real mode is lab/read-oriented educational scaffolding (process attach, optional kernel/DMA paths under opt-in flags). Default CMake config is simulation. High-risk paths (sample vulnerable driver, DMA firmware examples, elevated real backends) are lab-only — see [`radar/SECURITY.md`](radar/SECURITY.md).

Operators own compliance with platform terms, anti-cheat policy, and local law.

## Licensing

There is **no** single monorepo license. Each subtree keeps its own:

- `radar/` — MIT (`radar/LICENSE`)
- `vision/` — AGPL-3.0-only (`vision/LICENSE`); third-party notes in `vision/NOTICE.md` and [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md)

Code or docs that sit only at the monorepo root (these policy files) are dual-applicable packaging; when in doubt, treat shared root text as documentation, not a relicense of either tree.
