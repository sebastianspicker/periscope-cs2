# AC Research Lab

Educational red/blue lab for studying **external “legit” radar** — tools that read game memory and draw a map without aiming for you — and the detection techniques that push back.

This is the **radar** track of [Periscope](../README.md) (`periscope/radar`). Sister track: [`../vision/`](../vision/) (pixel-based outlining; separate stack and license). Not a cheat product and not a production anti-cheat.

Two ways to run it:

| Mode | What it does | Needs |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **Simulation** | Red plants scars on a deterministic `sim::World`; blue reasons over them | C++20 + CMake. Any OS. |
| **Real (Windows)** | Attach to a live process (CS2 for T0/T1), read entities, draw a radar overlay | VS/MSVC or Clang-CL, optional WDK / VMX / DMA hardware for higher tiers |

Default builds use `sim::World`. Real Windows backends are optional via CMake.

---

## Why it exists

Commercial “looks legit” radar packs escalate delivery as blue closes lower scars:

```
T0  OpenProcess + ReadProcessMemory
T1  Same handle, indirect / direct syscalls (hooks are theater)
T2  Kernel / BYOVD / memrw device (no game handle)
T3  Personal hypervisor + thin bridge
T4  Off-box DMA / capture residuals
```

Each tier has a red team library, a blue team library, runnable demos, and strategy pair lessons (apply → detect) under `scenarios/strategies/{t0..t4,crosscutting}/`.

## Build

### Simulation only (any platform)

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DLR_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DLR_BUILD_STRATEGY_LAB=ON
cmake --build build -j
```

### Real backends (Windows)

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DLR_ENABLE_REAL_ALL=ON
cmake --build build -j
```

Useful CMake flags:

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|------|:-------:|---------|
| `LR_BUILD_TESTS` | ON | CTest targets |
| `LR_BUILD_STRATEGY_LAB` | ON | `strategy_lab` CLI |
| `LR_BUILD_DUELS` | ON | `duel_tN` binaries |
| `LR_BUILD_PROTOS` | ON | Prototype demos |
| `LR_ENABLE_REAL_RPM` | OFF | OpenProcess / RPM |
| `LR_ENABLE_REAL_SYSCALL` | OFF | Syscall path |
| `LR_ENABLE_REAL_KERNEL` | OFF | Driver / IOCTL |
| `LR_ENABLE_REAL_VMX` | OFF | VT-x helpers |
| `LR_ENABLE_REAL_DMA` | OFF | DMA / PCIe helpers |
| `LR_ENABLE_REAL_GPU` | OFF | D3D11 overlay path |
| `LR_ENABLE_REAL_UEFI` | OFF | UEFI firmware analysis backend |
| `LR_ENABLE_REAL_LINUX` | OFF | Linux real backend and host stubs |
| `LR_ENABLE_REAL_ALL` | OFF | Flip the real stack on |

All real and live-reader options default to `OFF` on every platform. Use
`LR_ENABLE_REAL_ALL=ON` for the complete supported real stack or enable only
the individual backends needed for an isolated lab exercise.

Runtime knobs: `LR_MODE=sim|real|hybrid`, `LR_VERBOSE=0|1`.

## Try it

```bash
# Strategy catalog (simulation)
./build/strategy_lab list
LR_MODE=sim ./build/strategy_lab run 01_external_rpm
./build/strategy_lab all --quiet

# Per-tier deterministic simulation demos
./build/radar_t0
./build/radar_t1

# Windows GPU control panel demo (requires LR_ENABLE_REAL_GPU=ON)
./build/gui_demo

# Tests
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

`gui_demo` is created only when the real RPM, syscall, and GPU capabilities
are enabled. It uses simulated entities and does not require a game process.
`INSERT` toggles its control panel; `END` / `ESC` quit. Settings land in
`radar.ini` next to the binary.

Live catalog truth is always `./build/strategy_lab list` (hundreds of registered pairs under `scenarios/strategies/`).

## Safety / ethics

- Example vulnerable driver and DMA firmware are for **controlled lab use**. Do not load them on production machines.
- Real backends exercise OS APIs that commercial anti-cheat watches. Expect detection if you point them at a live game.
- This tree does **not** bypass HVCI/VBS, and it does **not** ship VMT hooks, injectors, or game-memory writers for gameplay advantage. Simulation plants scars on `sim::World`; real mode is read-oriented educational scaffolding.
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Short version: new lessons go under `scenarios/strategies/<tier>/` with red + blue + `LESSON.md`, register them in `scenarios/strategies/framework/registry.cpp`, and keep tests green.
